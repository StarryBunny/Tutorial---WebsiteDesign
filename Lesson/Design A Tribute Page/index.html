    <p>
        ☛ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full
        Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam,
        was born on October 15, 1931, in
        Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.<br><br>
        ☛ He served as the 11th President
        of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br>
        ☛ Kalam earned a degree in
        aeronautical engineering from the
        Madras Institute of Technology and in
        1958 joined the Defence Research and
        Development Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
        ☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian
        Space Research Organisation, where he
        was project director of the SLV-III, the
        first satellite launch vehicle that was
        both designed and produced in India.
        <br><br> ☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982,
        Kalam planned the program that produced
        a number of successful missiles, which
        helped earn him the nickname <strong>
            “Missile Man.”</strong>
        <br><br> ☛ Among those successes
        was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range
        ballistic missile, which incorporated
        aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
        in 1989.
        <br><br> ☛ He also played a
        pivotal organisational, technical,
        and political role in India's Pokhran-II
        nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
        the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
        <br><br> ☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam
        was scientific adviser to the defense
        minister, and he later served as principal
        scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
        government with the rank of cabinet minister.
        <br><br> ☛ His prominent role in
        the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests
        solidified India as a nuclear power and
        established Kalam as a national hero,
        although the tests caused great concern
        in the international community.
